# hot diva 2004

a random writing prompt generator webpage  with a catch: it's powered by [hotdiva2000](https://github.com/charmbracelet/hotdiva2000)!

the site is compiled from the **build.sh** script, which will randomly generate 100 strings with hotdiva2000, then create or update an index.html file that can be served anywhere.

styling can be customized through the **main.css** file.
