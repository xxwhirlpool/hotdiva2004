	    <p>this is a prompt generator site, built with a single bash script, but with a catch: the prompt list is generated by <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/hotdiva2000">hotdiva2000</a>!</p>
    	<p>100 strings are generated every hour. so don't wait, click the below button to get some bizarre strings and use them as writing prompts!</p>

    <button onclick="makePrompts()">click me :)</button>
